The futuristic Space Needle, a 1962 World\u2019s Fair legacy, is its most iconic landmark. As the demands and complexity of Seattle\u2019s transportation network grow, the information supporting decisions about that network continues to expand and now includes significant data on pedestrians, bicycles, trucks, etc. The Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) collects and maintains datasets including volumes, speeds, and collisions. The use of this data, guided by department plans and policies, serves as the foundation for making informed decisions. At this end, this study is trying to put something in place that can warn about the possibility of getting into a road collision and how severe it would be based on the weather and the road conditions. </p>"
